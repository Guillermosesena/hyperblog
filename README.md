Project created for the Git-GitHub course of Platzi. The purpose of this project is to practice commands for the version control system locally (Git) and remotely (GitHub). Using the main actions such as:
- Create a repository
- Clone a repository
- Add files to repository
- Commit code changes to repository
- Create branches
- Perform push

## Features

This repository includes a HTML and CSS documents for a blog home page. The HTML document contains a very simple design that includes an header, main section and footer. The CCS document set the blog layout (colors, sizes, fonts, etc). Two images were used, one is in the project repository (bad practice in GitHub) and the other is called remotely from an external link.
